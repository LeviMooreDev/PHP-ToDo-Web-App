I made this framework to achieve 3 things when working on personal web projects.
1. Easy reuse of code.
	Because everything is split into packages I can easily take them with me to my next project.
2. Easy updating of old projects.
	As I find and fix issues while working on new projects, old projects can just pull and merge to get them as well.
3. Fast prototyping.
	For big systems and paid work I normally use Laravel, but for things like a ToDo app or when prototyping, a simple framework structure is better.
